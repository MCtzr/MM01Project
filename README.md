**MM01Project**



**Description :**

  This website has been created as part of a project of my training at the University of Technology of Troyes. The website must be responsive, composed of 10 pages minimum, and must contain some effects (parallax, comment form). Finally, the website must have a responsive menu with a reduced form on smartphone and small screens.
